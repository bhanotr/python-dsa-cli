Hint Level 1:

General approach:
- Add all numbers to a hash set for O(1) lookups
- For each number, check if it's the start of a sequence
- Count consecutive numbers from sequence starts
- Track the longest sequence

Key concept:
- Start of sequence: num - 1 is NOT in set
- Only start counting from sequence beginnings
- Use hash set for O(1) lookup

Hash set:
```python
num_set = set(nums)  # O(n) to create
num in num_set       # O(1) lookup
```

Hint Level 2:

Detailed approach for longest_consecutive():
1. Create set from nums: num_set = set(nums)
2. For each num in num_set:
   a. If num - 1 not in set: sequence starts here
   b. Count consecutive: num+1, num+2, ...
   c. Update longest if this sequence is longer
3. Return longest sequence length

Example:
```python
nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
num_set = {100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2}

100: 99 not in set, start counting: 100 only (length 1)
4: 3 IS in set, skip
200: 199 not in set, start counting: 200 only (length 1)
1: 0 not in set, start counting: 1,2,3,4 (length 4)
3: 2 IS in set, skip
2: 1 IS in set, skip

Longest: 4
```

Sequence counting:
```python
current_num = num
current_streak = 1
while current_num + 1 in num_set:
    current_num += 1
    current_streak += 1
```

Hint Level 3:

Complete solution:
```python
from typing import List

def longest_consecutive(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    num_set = set(nums)
    longest = 0
    
    for num in num_set:
        # Check if this is start of sequence
        if num - 1 not in num_set:
            current_num = num
            current_streak = 1
            
            # Count consecutive numbers
            while current_num + 1 in num_set:
                current_num += 1
                current_streak += 1
            
            longest = max(longest, current_streak)
    
    return longest
```

Time complexity: O(n) - Each number visited at most twice
Space complexity: O(n) - Store all numbers in set

Why this is O(n):
- Each number is in exactly one sequence
- Only the start of each sequence triggers counting
- Total iterations across all sequences = n
