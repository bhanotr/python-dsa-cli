=== HINT LEVEL ===

Hint Level 1:

General approach:
- Track minimum price seen so far
- Calculate potential profit at each day
- Keep track of maximum profit found

Key concept:
- Profit = current_price - min_price_seen
- Update max_profit at each step
- Also update min_price as we go

Tracking variables:
```python
min_price = float('inf')  # Or first price
max_profit = 0
```

Hint Level 2:

Detailed approach for max_profit():
1. Initialize min_price and max_profit
2. For each price in prices:
   a. Calculate potential profit: price - min_price
   b. Update max_profit if this is better
   c. Update min_price if current price is lower
3. Return max_profit (0 if no profit possible)

Example:
```python
prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]

price=7: min=7, profit=0, max=0
price=1: min=1, profit=-6, max=0
price=5: min=1, profit=4, max=4
price=3: min=1, profit=2, max=4
price=6: min=1, profit=5, max=5  ✓
price=4: min=1, profit=3, max=5

Result: 5
```

Update logic:
```python
min_price = min(min_price, price)
max_profit = max(max_profit, price - min_price)
```

Hint Level 3:

Complete solution:
```python
from typing import List

def max_profit(prices: List[int]) -> int:
    if len(prices) < 2:
        return 0
    
    min_price = float('inf')
    max_profit = 0
    
    for price in prices:
        min_price = min(min_price, price)
        max_profit = max(max_profit, price - min_price)
    
    return max_profit
```

Time complexity: O(n) - Single pass
Space complexity: O(1) - Constant extra space

Alternative (brute force - O(n²)):
```python
def max_profit(prices: List[int]) -> int:
    max_profit = 0
    for buy in range(len(prices)):
        for sell in range(buy + 1, len(prices)):
            max_profit = max(max_profit, prices[sell] - prices[buy])
    return max_profit
```

Key insight:
- We don't need to track WHERE to buy/sell
- Just track minimum price and best profit
- Profit at any day = current_price - minimum_price_before
